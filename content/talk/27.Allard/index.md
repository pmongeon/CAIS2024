abstract: "The complex relationship between archival records and institutions, power, and history making is a shared concern of both archival and feminist research and praxis. This paper reports key findings of a systematic literature review (SLR) that examines the presence and prevalence of critical feminist theories, practices, and approaches employed in archival studies research between 1973-2024. Our key findings highlight how feminist approaches not only serve archival studies research that aims to promote visibility, credibility, control, and care to communities whose voices have been systematically excluded from mainstream archives but also encourages an array of archival functions and practices embedded in critical intersectional feminist values, methods, and ethics."
