abstract: "Tabletop role-playing games constitute a unique site for everyday life information behaviour. Non-participant observation sessions and semi-structured interviews with two gaming groups of 4-6 players will be conducted to understand more about both the negotiation of player identities and information seeking activities. Preliminary findings of this in-progress study will be shared that focus on how information sources are used both in and out of character, as well as on knowledge about barriers and facilitators to information."
