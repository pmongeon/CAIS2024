abstract: "Academic librarians and media scholars face increasing pressures to preserve, provide access to, and reuse media technology. Simultaneously, technological advances add complexities to assessing the applicability of fair dealing to unauthorized scholarly uses of copyright-protected content. To address these challenges, concerned members of these two communities have joined forces to create the Media Access and Copyright (MAC) Working Group. This session provides an overview of MACâ€™s structure and achievements as well as its current research project, the development of two codes of best practices aimed at supporting informed decision making in the application of fair dealing by scholars and practitioners."
