abstract: "This paper addresses the need for a paradigm shift in recordkeeping research that meets the needs of social justice agendas. I propose an approach that combines the social ontology of Dorothy Smithâ€™s method of inquiry, institutional ethnography, and a storied epistemology as the foundation for a new model for recordkeeping research that blurs boundaries to uncover and tell tales."
