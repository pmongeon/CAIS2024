abstract: "Due to their ability to formalize the knowledge of a domain into an explicit computer-interpretable specification (Gruber, 1995), the ontology representation model proves ideal for supporting the conduct of knowledge synthesis methods such as reviews systematics of the literature (Sahlab et al., 2022). Considering the rapid and continued increase in scholarly production, automating the development of these knowledge products is essential (Al-Aswadi et al., 2020). This presentation reports the first milestones of ongoing research aimed at evaluating the contribution of ontology learning methods to support literature synthesis reviews."
