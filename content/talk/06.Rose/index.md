abstract: "We reviewed the concepts in OpenAlex under the level 0 Environmental Science category. Using a mixed methods analysis, we graphed tree diagrams of the concepts and their subcategories, compared them with other knowledge organization systems, and assessed their use as indexing terms. Problems leaped out at us with hierarchization, redundancy, and relevance, which could make it more challenging to for users to stumble upon relevant information in environmental science research."
