abstract: "It is only recently that GLAMU institutions have realised the importance of collecting and documenting their queer communities. Developing connections with queer communities is vital to facilitate these endeavours to build sustainable and respectful relationships as well as collaborating with queer independent archives to preserve and make accessible their collections. Using a qualitative survey and interviews from selected New Zealand GLAMU institutions selected findings related to connections and collaborations demonstrated not only the necessity of establishing queer contacts but the importance of using queer, social and collegial networks to foster connections and collaborations."
