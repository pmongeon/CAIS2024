abstract: "Information is a key tool that enables care providers to be involved in the health and wellbeing of older adults in their care. While recognizing care providers’ information practices as work has slowly received scholarly attention, there has been little corresponding scholarly effort to frame family caregivers’ data practices as work. In this paper, I revisit an earlier study to determine whether family caregivers’ information work and data work are sufficiently different so as to be distinguished as different forms of work."
