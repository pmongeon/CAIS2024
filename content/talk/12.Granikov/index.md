abstract: "This participatory case study investigates how collaborative learning can enhance critical health literacy, which is instrumental for making informed health decisions, managing, and preventing health problems. Data collection sources include participant observations, interviews, and project documents, which will be analyzed using deductive-inductive thematic analysis. The study focuses on one case â€“ a group that meets regularly online to improve digital literacy skills, hosted by an independent community library in Montreal, Canada. As this is research in progress, preliminary findings will be shared. Ultimately, this community-based project will provide useful insights to community partners, librarians, health organizations, and educators."
