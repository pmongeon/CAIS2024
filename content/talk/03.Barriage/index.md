abstract: "Drag storytimes are one type of programming that public libraries offer to address the marginalization of LGBTQIA+ children and families in library spaces. The books read during these storytimes often feature LGBTQIA+ characters and themes. In this work in progress, we will compare the subject metadata assigned within the Library of Congress Catalog and the social cataloging platform LibraryThing to a corpus of picture books read during drag storytimes. We will consider the limitations of using traditional subject headings in capturing the diversity of LGBTQIA+ themes and if the application of user-generated tags offers a more nuanced reflection of content."
