abstract: "This paper describes a childrenâ€™s literature course for school librarian candidates with an intentional focus on reflective practice and perspective consciousness regarding diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging. Qualitative methods revealed candidates' recognized changes in their perspective and practice, including the vital need to introduce their students to diverse materials that act as mirrors, windows, and sliding glass doors; and that, as librarians, they have power and can act as change agents within their schools and communities. This research provides evidence that introducing perspective consciousness into pre-service education preparation programs results in leaps forward for candidates and their future practice."
