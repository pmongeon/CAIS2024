abstract: "This is a 90-minute roundtable discussion, moderated by Shirin G. Alamdari. The term Cultural Heritage Informatics is being used widely in Information fields and by Information Studies Scholars and programs. This panel will address the questions: What is Cultural Heritage Informatics? Why do researchers and institutions stumble with a definition? Does Cultural Heritage Informatics define a methodology, a subject interest, or a set of technical practices? What kinds of ethical considerations could we, or should we, have?"
