abstract: "The phenomenon of underemployment of MLIS-degree holding paraprofessionals has not been seriously undertaken as a matter of research concern, except for a few mentions over the past half-century. This study reports on the partial findings of a survey of Canadian and American paraprofessionals who hold a graduate degree in LIS. This report seeks to explore whether a paraprofessional role can be considered a “stepping stone” to a professional role."
