abstract: "This paper examines library workersâ€™ experiences, concerns, and self-described needs through the #ProtectLibraryWorkers movement to establish what kinds of supports library workers need most to successfully handle community-wide crises. Utilizing thematic content analysis methodology, 600 randomly selected tweets from the first two years of the movement were analyzed, resulting in the emergence of eight primary themes and 30 sub-themes. Among these findings is a clear and present need for library researchers to reconsider the types of questions they are asking when it comes to investigating how library workers are impacted by crises."
