This paper reviews the literature conceptualizing digital placemaking as an information practice, examining the intersection of digital technologies and information practices in reshaping interactions within urban environments. We address the complex interplay between technology, information, and urban living to advance the fieldâ€™s theoretical and practical understanding of rapidly evolving digital landscapes. By highlighting the role of information research in smart city development, we argue for human-centered, inclusive, and sustainable approaches, ensuring that technological advancements align with the needs and aspirations of urban communities."
