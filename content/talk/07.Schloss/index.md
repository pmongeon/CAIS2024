abstract: "The integration of technology in therapy has grown significantly, driven by factors such as accessibility, affordability, and heightened user engagement. This paper explores technology's transformative impact on psychotherapy, focusing on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) as a pioneer in adopting technology-based interventions. Examining sensor-based wearables, computer/web-based platforms, mobile applications, and immersive media, the paper underscores their potential to revolutionize mental health care. Emphasizing the unique contribution of Information Scholars, the paper advocates for their involvement to provide a socio-technical, user-centered perspective in designing the digital tools evolving and emerging in the therapy technology landscape."
