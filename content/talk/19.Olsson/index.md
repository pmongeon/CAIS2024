abstract: "This paper makes the case for practice architectures (Kemmis, et al., 2014; Mahon et al. 2017) as a useful conceptual tool in information practices research. It argues that practice architectures provides a meso-sociological framework which might be used to address long-standing critique of the narrow focus on the individual information seeker in traditional information research. The paper provides a brief overview of the frameworkâ€™s key concepts (e.g. cultural-discursive, material-economic, social-political arrangements). It uses findings from an ongoing study of information practices in archaeological contexts to provide an example of how they can be applied to information practices research."
