abstract: "We tend to watch pornography discreetly, in private homes and on personal devices, so adult media consumption is largely conceived of as a private pursuit. On sites like Pornhub, however, algorithmic curation is optimised around engagement. Content management systems are fundamentally premised on surveillance, meaning that as users watch pornography, platforms watch users. 


Rather than shying away from this scopophilic regime, Pornhub routinely circulates colourful infographics and cheeky data visualisations detailing the porn viewing habits of millions of users. By teasing their profit model based on user data, Pornhub Insights doubly capitalise on the productive value of attention. While this marketing tactic has successfully transformed the fraught topics of porn and surveillance into benign PR, it also naturalises the role of platforms. Pornhub is an agent of commerce and technology that profoundly interferes in media ecosystems. Rather than neutrally reporting on user behaviour, it is shaping it through data-driven processes of recommendation, moderation and curation. In this talk, Maggie explores the operational logic of porn platforms and questions the reification of data through Pornhub Insights.  "
