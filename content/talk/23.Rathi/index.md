abstract: "Soft skills are people-oriented skills, and they, like technical (hard) skills, are essential for employees including faculty members. A qualitative pilot study was conducted with eight current and retired faculty members to learn how they acquired and/or honed soft skills during their doctoral program. The analysis of semi-structured interviews revealed that the participants explicitly and implicitly gained soft skills through formal and informal opportunities during their program of study. This study will contribute to literature related to soft skills, particularly in the context of academic work. The study also aims to draw attention to the ways in which soft skills can be systematically and intentionally taught and nurtured during a doctoral studentâ€™s program of study."
