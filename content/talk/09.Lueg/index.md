abstract: "A plethora of information is available regarding healthy aging lifestyle choices and how to adapt to lifestyle changes that are associated with aging. Preliminary literature review findings suggest that there is a gap in the informational landscape regarding information services that can help older adults understand, on their
own, where they are on their highly individualized lifeâ€™s journey; these services would include information on how to navigate challenges regarding maintaining an independent lifestyle and potentially losing the ability to make informed decisions."
