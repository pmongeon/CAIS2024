abstract: "Taking advantage of research sources emanating from outside of North America requires researchers’ fluency in world languages. Similarly, peer reviewers should be able to evaluate the cited sources while vetting scholarly work. However, given the widespread monolingualism and challenges accessing international scholarship, many critical sources may be missed, which can be particularly detrimental in multicultural studies. Using an example of Chinese-language sources from the federally funded study of multilingual readers in the U.S., the authors highlight essential publications that may be overlooked by researchers unable to read Chinese. This could become a major “stumble,” leading to knowledge gaps and biases."
