abstract: "With growing interest in the relationship between information literacy and intellectual virtue, the time is ripe for a closer look at open-mindedness. A traditional approach to the trait offers a limited perspective and does not fit well with a socio-cultural approach to information literacy. This presentation explores intra-active open-mindedness as an alternative account that lifts the trait out of the individual and places it in conversation with a socio-cultural approach."
