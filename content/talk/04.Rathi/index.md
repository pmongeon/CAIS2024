abstract: "Decolonization and reconciliation require ongoing commitments from organizations. This research examined strategic priorities/plans of 12 Canadian academic libraries to gain insight into their efforts towards decolonization and reconciliation. The findings revealed that a number of academic libraries are expressing their commitments to and setting strategies for decolonization and reconciliation, which are reflected in emerging themes such as collaboration and engagement with Indigenous Communities, improvements to virtual and physical infrastructure, inclusion of acknowledgements, focus on human resource management, reexamine collection development, program and services, support for research, and review of access and cataloging. This research will contribute to literature, and provide thoughts and ideas to other Canadian Library and Information Studies (LIS) organizations on ways to undertake initiatives towards decolonization and reconciliation."
