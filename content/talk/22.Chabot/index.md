abstract: "Weight stigma can be considered the last acceptable form of discrimination. This work examines the reasons why fat concerns should be undertaken by the discipline of LIS and the profession of librarianship. In imagining a fat future, we offer a call-to-action for fat scholars to centre their fat epistemology and to take up the methods of the discipline of fat studies. In conclusion, we offer an introduction to our research agenda in this area."
