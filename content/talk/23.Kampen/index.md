abstract: "In this lightning talk I use an autoethnographic and narrative approach to discuss the generative and obstructive potential of discipline envy and method jealousy in developing research topics in Information Science (IS). I describe how envy and jealousy shaped the development of my doctoral research topic, information-sharing of artist-researchers, and aim to provoke reflection on cross-disciplinary research"
