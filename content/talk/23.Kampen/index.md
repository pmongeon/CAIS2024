abstract: "In this lightening talk I will discuss the generative and obstructive potential of discipline envy and method jealousy in developing research topics in Information Science (IS). By drawing on the “how we done it good” approach (Clarke, 2018), I describe how envy and jealousy shaped the development of my doctoral research topic: the information-sharing of artist-researchers."
