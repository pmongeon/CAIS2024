abstract: "Is it possible to remove the inherent bias of the Library of Congress Classification System? The organisation structures that dictate how knowledge is presented in the library carry a degree of power in how library patrons perceive knowledge about themselves and one another, but these systems carry inherent biases which can cause harm to patrons. Through a synthesis of the reparative goals of Critical classification and traditions of experimental Avant grade literature this experimental classification schema attempts to remove the bias of conscious input from cataloguing by creating a Cut-up method classification system governed by the principle of chance."
