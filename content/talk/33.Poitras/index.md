abstract: "A researcher wishing to “make the jump” from one disciplinary classification system to another as his or her career progresses may encounter inadequacies between the systems. With a view to subsequently building a tool allowing visualization of these different systems, this study will make it possible to present a global perspective of research on these systems as well as to identify different methodological approaches used to understand the connections between classification systems. More specifically, this literature review focuses on research relating to the comparison of different disciplinary classification systems."
