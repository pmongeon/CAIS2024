abstract: "We performed a content analysis of the user interface (UI) designs for five social networking sites (SNSs) popular among teens. As a result of this analysis, we identified UI design tactics that undermine people’s social privacy – or privacy dark patterns – and consolidated these tactics into a typology consisting of two main types (Obstruction and Obfuscation) and seven subtypes."
