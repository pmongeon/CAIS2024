abstract: "While little is known about how LIS programs are preparing students for careers as data-related academic librarians, trying to research those programs presents a range of challenges, from getting ethics approval as external researchers to contacting potential participants to having sufficient sample sizes. In this talk, we share our experiences from an autoethnographic methodological approach, in hopes that this will help others doing this kind of research going forward."
