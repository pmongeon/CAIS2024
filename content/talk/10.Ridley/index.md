abstract: "Currently explainable AI (XAI) is embedded in large, centralized platforms such as Facebook, Google or TikTok. These platforms control the nature and extent of explanations for their recommendations, decisions, and predictions raising the possibility of manipulation or deception. Human centered XAI (HCXAI) promotes explanatory systems not merely explanations as part of a set of principles supporting the non-expert, lay public. Moving from platform enabled HCAXI to protocol based HCXAI would facilitate user focused, independent explanatory systems more conducive to building and sustaining user trust and system accountability."
