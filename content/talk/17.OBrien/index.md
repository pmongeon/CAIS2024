abstract: "We share preliminary findings from an interview study with 24 Library and Information Studies (LIS) professionals engaged in knowledge exchange (KE) work. Specifically, we examine the challenge of evaluating relational work and the disconnect between existing LIS evaluation frameworks and practices with respect to demonstrating social value. We speculate on the contribution of KE discourse and impact models to LIS assessment and evaluation."
