abstract: "We will present the first phase of research aimed at developing our knowledge, which is currently lacking, about the engagement of public and school libraries and the actions carried out with schools and the various actors and actresses to improve literacy from a community perspective. The methodology is that of multiple case studies using interviews conducted in six different sites in Quebec. The results will shed light on the collaborative strategies adopted to improve access to educational resources, promote reading among young people and strengthen links between community actors."
