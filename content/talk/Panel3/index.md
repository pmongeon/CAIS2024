abstract: Whether leaping or stumbling, writing is the final and arguably most difficult and important stage of the research process. Our evolving literature review reveals, however, that writing receives little attention as a practice within Library and Information Scienceâ€™s methodological armamentarium. Accordingly, this panel engages the CAIS community in a constructive and serious discussion concerning writing within our discipline. An overview of the literature will be offered, accompanied by four presentations by writing strategists featuring distinct contemplative, critical, ethnographic, and institutional visions. The panel will conclude with questions, a discussion, and the brainstorming of potential positive interventions in writing practice."
